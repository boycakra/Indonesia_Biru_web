                        The UN's recent report on plastic pollution signals a dire future, projecting a doubling of plastic waste by 2030.
                        In response, the Indonesia Biru Foundation (IBF) emphasizes the critical need for immediate action and collective
                        efforts to combat this escalating crisis.

                        <p>
                            The report, titled "From Pollution to Solution: a global assessment of marine litter and plastic pollution,"
                            outlines severe consequences for health, economy, biodiversity, and climate. The urgent call for a reduction
                            in unnecessary plastic use aligns with IBF's commitment to environmental conservation.

                            IBF advocates for an accelerated transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies and the removal of subsidies,
                            aligning with the report's recommendations. The foundation emphasizes the need for circular approaches to reduce
                            plastic waste and safeguard marine ecosystems.
