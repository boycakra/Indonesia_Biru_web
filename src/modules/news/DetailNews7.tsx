                    In pursuing a hands-on approach to biodiversity preservation, the Indonesia Biru Foundation (IBF) focuses on coral reef restoration. This comprehensive initiative involves the responsible harvesting of small fragments from healthy coral, ensuring minimal impact on existing ecosystems. Subsequently, these fragments are meticulously planted on spider constructions, providing a conducive environment for growth and the formation of new colonies. Through regular monitoring during dives, IBF keeps track of the progress and state of the planted coral fragments. The data collected is pivotal for ongoing improvement, enabling IBF to refine its methods and identify resilient coral species.<br />
                    {" "} <br />
                    IBF's commitment to marine conservation has found an ally in the Restor Team, a group of scientists and technologists based in Zurich, Switzerland. Restor connects and supports restoration action globally, fostering a culture where individuals passionate about environmental conservation can thrive. The Restor Team's impact extends across continents, bringing together diverse talents working on projects ranging from software development to bioacoustics monitoring solutions in remote jungles.
