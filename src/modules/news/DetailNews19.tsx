                        <p>
                            Today marks an exciting milestone as Indonesia Biru Foundation (IBF) joins hands with Elemetry School in Lombok for a collaborative art project aimed at cleaning up our coastlines. With the support of @infosd.lombokinsanischool, we are embarking on a mission to collect rubbish and transform it into meaningful works of art.

                            Our first step is to collect rubbish from the coastline, gathering discarded items that threaten the health of our marine ecosystems. With each piece of rubbish collected, we are not only cleaning up our environment but also reclaiming materials that can be repurposed for artistic expression. From plastic bottles to discarded fishing nets, every item has the potential to become part of something beautiful.
                            Once the rubbish has been collected, our next task is to sort it into different categories and colors. This process allows us to organize the materials and identify opportunities for creative reuse. Additionally, we will ensure that each item is thoroughly cleaned to remove any debris or contaminants, ensuring the safety and integrity of our art materials.
                            As we embark on this inspiring journey, we invite you to stay tuned for updates on our collaborative art project. Follow Indonesia Biru Foundation on Instagram for behind-the-scenes footage, progress reports, and glimpses into the creative process. Together, let's turn the tide on ocean pollution and create a brighter future for our planet.
