                        <h2>The Importance of Coral Reefs</h2>
                        <p>
                            Coral reefs are crucial to the health of our oceans. They provide a habitat for countless marine species, protect coastlines from erosion, and contribute to the overall biodiversity of our planet. Unfortunately, coral reefs are facing numerous threats, including climate change, overfishing, and pollution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Coral Connect event aims to raise awareness about the importance of coral reefs and the need for collective efforts to protect and preserve them. By bringing together organizations, experts, and enthusiasts, we hope to spark meaningful discussions and inspire concrete actions for the conservation of these vital ecosystems.
