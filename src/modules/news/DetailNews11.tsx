                        During the workshop, IBF extended its outreach to the local community, introducing a unique approach to coral planting. Participants learned how to create ceramic structures that could serve as anchors for coral fragments, facilitating their attachment to the sea floor. This not only provided an insightful hands-on experience for sailing enthusiasts but also empowered the local community with knowledge about sustainable practices in marine conservation.
