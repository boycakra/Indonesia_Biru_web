                            In 2023, Indonesia Biru Foundation (IBF) achieved significant milestones, marking a year of growth and impact.
                            The IBF family expanded by welcoming three full-time employees from Lombok, strengthening our roots.
                            Initiatives such as the establishment of the Coral Lab at Kecinan Bay and collaboration with Southern Lombok businesses
                            underscore our commitment to holistic marine conservation.
